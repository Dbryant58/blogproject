    <h1>Why I Chose the Tech Field</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Mykayla Graham, an Information Technology major with a concentration in Cybersecurity, and I attend the illustrious North Carolina Central University. </p>
    <p>The reason I chose to be in the technology field was because I have always had an interest for technology. Since a young girl, I enjoyed working with my computer and cellular devices. I always had to have the latest devices just so I wouldn't miss out and experience every update on the newest technology. I also love technology because it is the future. Everyday, technology advances and only gets more and more creative and I would love to one day be apart of that new creation. </p>
